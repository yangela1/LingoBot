<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="images/project_image.png">

LingoBot is developed using Python and the `discord.py` library. Drawing inspiration from Duolingo, I aimed to create a
tool that makes learning new words effortless and enjoyable, all within an environment many of us already use
daily‚ÄîDiscord. This integration eliminates the need to switch between applications, making it a convenient leisurely
learning tool.
LingoBot combines the elements of a word-guessing game with the utility of a language learning app. The game allows
players to earn coins and buy items in a virtual shop, while also encouraging friendly competition through a server-wide
leaderboard and a reward system. Game statistics and the vocabulary each player learns are stored in MongoDB.

Several APIs are used to fetch words, their definitions, and images corresponding to the words including Vercel,
RapidAPI, and Pexels.

This project is my first bot utilizing the `discord.ext.commands.Bot` class, and it operates with the traditional
command prefix '$' without Slash commands.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

First make sure you have all the tokens listed below to interact with the APIs.

### Prerequisites

#### Required tokens:

* [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)
    * user
    * password
    * connection string
    * database
* [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/hub)
* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/license/)

#### Required permissions:

Make sure your bot has the following permissions: `application.commands` scope enabled found under the `Installation`tab
in the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).

Enable the `Presence Intent`, `Server Members Intents` and `Message Content Intent` which can be found under the `Bot`
tab.

### Database configuration:

1. Create the Database:

* Use a cloud MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas or have MongoDB installed and running on your machine
* Create a new database for your Discord Bot in the MongoDB shell or the MongoDB Atlas dashboard

2. Create Collections:

* In your database, create three collections: `users`, `words`, and `word_of_the_day`
    * `users` collection stores user data organized by unique Discord Server IDs for each document. Within the `users`
      object field, it contains many `id` objects, each representing a user in the server. The `id` key is represented
      by the unique Discord ID (Number) of each user. Each `id` object has its own details, including the user's unique
      Discord ID, Discord name, hearts, coins, words learned in different languages, wrong words guessed, number of
      correct guesses, number of incorrect guesses, and number of challenges completed.
    * `words` collection stores data on the words including their definition. The `Translation_language` key represents
      the language to which the word is translated. This field exists in the document and stored only during Challenge
      mode play. The value of `Translation_language` is the translation of the word in the specified language.
    * `word_of_the_day` collection stores the current word of the day with their definition and date in the format
      YYYY-MM-DD.
  > Note: the keys represented by languages are capitalized.
* Database schemas
    * Here's the database schema for the `users` collection in a JSON representation:

```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "guild_id": "Number",
  "users": {
    "id": {
      "discord_id": "Number",
      "name": "String",
      "hearts": "Number",
      "coins": "Number",
      "words_learned": {
        "English": [],
        "Spanish": [],
        "French": [],
        "German": [],
        "Italian": [],
        "Swedish": []
      },
      "wrong_words": [],
      "correct_guess": "Number",
      "incorrect_guess": "Number",
      "chal_complete": "Number"
    }
  }
}
```

* Here's the database schema for the `words` collection:

```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "word": "String",
  "definition": "String",
  "Translation_language": "String"
}
```

* Here's the database schema for the `word_of_the_day` collection:

```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "word": "String",
  "definition": "String",
  "date": "String"
}
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash 
$ git clone https://github.com/yangela1/LingoBot.git
```

2. Open up the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and copy the provided keys into it,
   replacing `INSERT_YOUR_X_HERE` with your actual tokens.

```python
DISCORD_TOKEN = "INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
MONGO_HOST = "INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
MONGO_USER = "INSERT_YOUR_USER_HERE"
MONGO_PASSWORD = "INSERT_YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE"
DATABASE = "INSERT_YOUR_DATABASE_NAME_HERE"
PEXELS_KEY = "INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
X_RAPIDAPIKEY = "INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
X_RAPIDHOST_WORDS = "wordsapiv1.p.rapidapi.com"
X_RAPIDHOST_TRANSLATE = "google-translate113.p.rapidapi.com"
```

4. Install the following dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install discord.py pymongo dotenv requests
```

5. Run the application and the bot will come online.

```bash
$ python3 main.py
```

### ‚ùì Help

The help reply is sent to your DMs.

The message provides a detailed list of commands you can use for the bot.

```$help```

<img src="images/help.png">
<img src="images/help1.png">
<img src="images/help2.png"> 

### üí∞ Currency Guide

The help reply is sent to the channel.

When you play games, you earn currencies called 'kiwis'. There are two types of kiwis available: green kiwis and gold
kiwis. Each game mode awards a different amount of currency. Details about the shop commands and the costs of items are
also provided.

```$k```

<img src="images/k.png">

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### üéÆ Play

Play the word guessing game. There are three game modes: normal, hard, and easy.

üü† **Normal mode**: Guess the translation of an English word.

```$play```

<img src="images/play.png">

üî¥ **Hard mode**: Guess the translation of a word in one of these languages (Spanish, French, German, Italian, Swedish).

```$chal```

<img src="images/chal.png">

üü¢ **Easy mode**: Guess the translation of an English word you've previously guessed incorrectly.

```$requiz```

<img src="images/requiz.png">

### üèÅ Gameplay and Rewards Information

LingoBot provides feedback on your chosen answer. Your game statistics are updated after each guess and the new word is
also stored to the database.

In the `users` Collection:

* Correctly guessed words are stored in the words_learned field in MongoDB.
* Incorrectly guessed words are stored in the wrong_words field in MongoDB.
* A correct answer for $requiz updates both word banks.

In the `words` Collection:

* The word is stored along with its definition and/or translation.

<u>üéâIf you win</u>:

* in Easy mode ($requiz): earn green kiwis
* in Normal mode ($play): earn green kiwis
* in Hard ($chal): earn green kiwis and gold kiwis

<u>üíîIf you lose or timeout</u>:

* in all modes: no kiwis are earned and you lose a life
 
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### üîç Hints

Buying a hint costs a certain amount of kiwis depending on the game mode. A synonym of the word is given.
> Note: Hints are unable to be used in the easy game mode (`$requiz`).

```$hint```

<img src="images/hint.png">

### ‚è© Pass

Buying a pass costs a certain amount of kiwis depending on the game mode. A pass will skip the current word without any
penalties and start a new game of the same mode.
> Note: Passes are unable to be used in the easy game mode (`$requiz`).

```$pass```

<img src="images/pass.png">

### ‚ù§ Buy Lives

three.
